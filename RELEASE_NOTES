v1.0.1 (November 24th 2012)
---------------------------

bugfix release
- fix support for installing easybuild-easyblocks with distutils (broken import in setup.py)
- only build GMP/CLooG/PPL libraries during GCC build in parallel, don't install in parallel
    - 'make -j N install' doesn't work consistently for GMP
- fix GCC build on OS X
    - location of libraries is slightly different (lib vs lib64 dir)
- add support to ConfigureMake easyblock for pre-passing tar options to configure
    - see tar_config_opts easyconfig parameter
    - workaround for issue with pax hanging configure with an interactive prompt
- enhance Q&A for WRF and WIEN2k by adding entries to qa dict and no_qa list
- use rmtree2 from tools/filetools.py as more (NFS) robust replacement for shutil.rmtree

v1.0 (November 13th 2012)
-------------------------

- split up EasyBuild across three repositories: framework, easyblocks and easyconfigs
- packaged EasyBuild, different parts can now be installed easily using easy_install
- implement class name encoding scheme, see wiki http://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Encode-class-names
    - (non-generic) easyblock class names are now prefixed with EB and non-alphanumeric characters are escaped
- split off generic easyblocks into separate package easyblocks.generic
- added custom support for 39 software packages:
    Armadillo, BiSearch, Boost, Bowtie2, BWA, bzip2, CGAL, CPLEX, DOLFIN, Eigen, flex, FSL, Hypre, libxml2, MetaVelvet,
    METIS, MTL4, MUMmer, ncurses, OpenFOAM, OpenSSL, ParMETIS, Pasha, PETSc, Primer3, python-meep, SAMtools, SCOTCH,
    SHRiMP, SLEPc, SOAPdenovo, SuiteSparse, SWIG, Tornado, Trilinos, UFC, Velvet, WIEN2k, XCrySDen
- various enhancements and bug fixes to existing easyblocks

v0.8 (June 29th 2012)
---------------------

- added support for building/installing 17 additional software packages:
    - BEAGLE, Doxygen, g2clib, g2lib, HDF, HDF5, JasPer, libpng, Maple, 
      MrBayes, NCL, netCDF, netCDF-Fortran, Szip, WPS, WRF, zlib
- the build procedure for WRF and WPS includes running the tests available for these packages
- various bug fixes and enhancements:
    - made support for interactive installers (run_cmd_qa) more robust
    - fixed Python git package check
    - implemented toolkit functions for determine compiler family, MPI type, MPI run command, ...

v0.7 (June 18th 2012)
---------------------

- fixed BLACS build
    - diagnostic tools to determine INTERFACE and TRANSCOMM values are now used
- added support for building Bison, CP2K, flex
    - with regression test enabled for CP2K as part of build process
    - note: BLACS built with EasyBuild prior to v0.7 needs to be rebuilt for CP2K to work correctly
- added --enable-mpi-threads to OpenMPI example easyconfigs
    - required for correct CP2K psmp build
- adjusted libsmm example easyconfig for lower build time
    - to make the full regression test finish in a reasonable amount of time
- added script to make porting of easyblocks from old to new EasyBuild codebase easier
    - takes care of refactoring, checks for PyLint warnings/errors, ...
- fixed several small bugs
- prefixed EasyBuild messages with "=="
- full regression test passed (58 easyconfigs tested)

v0.6 (May 11th 2012)
---------------------

- added support for Intel compiler toolkit (ictce)
    - which included the Intel compilers, Intel Math Kernel Library (imkl) and Intel MPI library (impi)
- added support for building Python with nose/numpy/scipy packages
- added simple regression test
- this version is able to build all supplied example easyconfigs

v0.5 (April 6th 2012)
----------------------

- first public release of EasyBuild
    - after a thorough cleanup of the EasyBuild framework of the in-house version
- supports building HPL with goalf compiler toolkit
