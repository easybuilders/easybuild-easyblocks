"""
EasyBuild support for building and installing a Pythonpackage independend of a python version as an easyblock.

Python installs libraries by defailt in site-packages/python-xxx/
But packages that are not dependend on the python version can be installed in a different prefix, e.g. lib
as long as we add this folder to the pythonpath.
